# Energy-Production-app-NOVAIMS

This project uses data about energy production in the world. We analyze how much renewable and not renewable energy each country used from 1965 to 2020.
Inside these two major types of energy, we go more into deep by analyzing different types of renewable energy (e.g: From wind or water) and also different kinds of not renewable energy(e.g: Coal and nuclear energy).
This project aims to compare the production of all these types of energies by each country so that we can conclude what are the countries with a bigger role in the green planet and the ones that are still way behind the curve in that sense. To get the data we use the website “OurWorldInData” and we merged data from two different repositories(one for renewable energy and the other for not renewable energy).
